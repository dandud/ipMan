ipMan - IP Address Profile Manager
================
I find I have to change adapter IP addresses frequently.  In lieu of the batch files that I typically use to handle this, I have started this project to further my knowledge and create a useful utility.  First attempt at C# so please feel free to submit recommendations.


Desired Features
----------------
* GUI
* Autoload NIC confiuration
* Configure NIC 
* Profile save
* Import/Export profiles via CSV or similar method
